# Kickstarter Dataset Analysis

## Overview

Louise is about to launch a campaign and came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. As it is getting closer, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Which will give her an analysis how best to approach the campaign

### Purpose

By creating a “Kickstarter dataset”, we can help Louise visualize the campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals through some analysis and challenges.

## Result

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date - (including in the Dataset)
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals - (including in the Dataset)

Based on the analysis, it will be best to start the fundraising during the months of May and June, as it shows a higher rate of funding from individuals as well as other organizations (profit and non-profit).

Performing analysis on Kickstarter DataWe need to have strong follow up with potential donors, as more or a huge portion of the donations comes from those sharing the same goals or partially. A strong process and effective campaign is needed, especially reaching out through social media, as it is the era we’re living.

Also, always remember to say Thank you.
